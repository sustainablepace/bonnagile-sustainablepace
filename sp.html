That was when 17 mawgs who cared about projects and software got together to discuss what were then called Lightweight Methodologies. XP had just taken off, and SCRUM was making waves, and we all wanted to see if there was enough common ground for us to isolate some underlying principles. In the end, I think we did something far more important—we isolated a set of four common values, and wrote them up as the Agile Manifesto.

As the conversation began to gel, I wrote down a short bullet list of things we were saying:

		Maßgeblich an der Entwicklung des Agilen Manifests beteiligt war Kent Beck.
		In seinem Buch "Extreme Programming Explained" aus dem Jahr 1999 hat er unter anderem folgendes postuliert:
		(Satz vorlesen)

"I want to be fresh and eager every morning, and tired and satisfied every night. On 
Friday, I want to be tired and satisfied enough that I feel good about two days to 
think about something other than work. Then on Monday I want to come in full of 
fire and ideas. 
Whether this translates into precisely 40 hours per week at the work site is not 
terribly important. Different people have different tolerances for work. One person 
might be able to put in 35 concentrated hours, another 45. But no one can put in 60 
hours a week for many weeks and still be fresh and creative and careful and 
confident. Don't do that. 
Overtime is a symptom of a serious problem on the project. The XP rule is simple—
you can't work a second week of overtime. For one week, fine, crank and put in 
some extra hours. If you come in Monday and say, "To meet our goals, we'll have to 
work late again," then you already have a problem that can't be solved by working 
more hours. 
A related issue is vacation. Europeans often take vacations of two, three, or four 
straight weeks. Americans seldom take more than a few days at a time. If it were my 
company, I would insist that people take a two-week vacation every year, with at 
least another week or two available for shorter breaks."

"The rule should be called Sustainable Pace, not Forty Hour Week. The notion is that productivity does not increase with hours worked. Tired programmers are less productive than well-rested ones.

"Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and
users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely."

There are two sides to this statement. One relates to social responsibility side, the other to
project effectiveness. Not everyone at the meeting was interested in signing onto the social
responsibility platform, but we all agreed on the effectiveness issue.

People tire as they put in long hours.Their rate of progress slows, not just during their overtime
hours, but also during their regular hours. They introduce more errors into their work. Diminishing
returns set in with extra hours. This is part of the non-linearity of the human component.
An alert and engaged staff is more agile than a tired, slogging staff, even leaving aside all of the
social responsibility issues. Long hours are a symptom that something has gone wrong with the
project layout."

One counterintuitive way to increase your productivity is to work fewer hours per day. Even back in the early 1900s, studies had shown that working 10 hours a day did not result in any more production output than eight.

That’s why Henry Ford decided to scale back the work week for his employees, while still paying them the same amount. First he cut back from 10-hour to 8-hour shifts. Then, he trimmed the work week from six days to five.

"Now we know from our experience in changing from six to five days and back again that we can get at least as great production in five days as we can in six… Just as the eight hour day opened our way to prosperity, so the five day week will open our way to a still greater prosperity.” — Henry Ford

Our industry is characterized by long nights and weekends, during which people try to undo the errors of unresponsive planning. Ironically, these long hours don't actually lead to greater productivity. Martin and Kent Beck have often recalled working at companies where they spent all day removing errors made late the previous night.

Agility relies upon people who are alert and creative, and can maintain that alertness and creativity for the full length of a software development project. Sustainable development means finding a working pace (40 or so hours a week) that the team can sustain over time and remain healthy.

How long should crunch last? There have been studies that show the real effectiveness of crunch. For us, the proof came the last time management enforced company wide overtime (in 2005). We "asked" the teams to work 6 days a week at 10 hours a day to finish Darkwatch. The proof came from the velocity observed in burndown charts.

The following chart shows how much time the teams averaged in burning off their estimated hours per week:

The first week was a normal ~ 40 hour week. Weeks 2-5 were the 60 hour weeks. The first thing you notice is that the overtime in week 2 caused the velocity to greatly increase. More "stuff" was getting done! However the velocity decreased until we get to week 5 where the velocity was even less than a normal week!

How is this possible? It's simple. People get tired. They make more mistakes. They lose the incentive to create value.

This is what I love about Scrum...it creates simple empirical evidence about what works and what doesn't. This is why there is no "rule" about overtime in Scrum. There doesn't need to be a rule. If your teams are truly using Scrum to find the best way to work, they'll quickly discover that after several weeks of moderate overtime, the value is lost and you might as well not continue. It becomes common sense.

"One time on your author’s common project, C3, the entire team went
into a heavy-overtime mode, in order to meet some delivery date. (Yes,
even extreme teams can get up against a deadline once in a while.
Scope had not been managed properly, and we were up against it.) We
worked really hard for a few weeks. Most of the team were coming in
on weekends, in the middle of the night, and generally acting like we
were in Silicon Valley instead of Michigan.
After the crunch was over, we all took some time off and then got back
to it. We looked upon the work we had done in the overtime period,
and unlike the Creator, we did not see that it was good. In fact, it was
bad1. We found poorly written code; we found untested code; we
found unrefactored code. We found all pig iron.

During the crunch, we were honestly doing our best. Our best just
wasn’t very good, because we were tired. We can’t prove it yet, but
from our own experience we are certain that heavy overtime is bad.
Thus the XP rule, 40-hour week: Do not work more than one consecu-
tive week of overtime."

"The worst code I ever wrote was at 3 am. The year was 1988, and I was working
at a telecommunications start-up named Clear Communications. We were all
putting in long hours in order to build “sweat equity.” We were, of course, all
dreaming of being rich.

One very late evening—or rather, one very early morning, in order to solve a
timing problem—I had my code send a message to itself through the event
dispatch system (we called this “sending mail”). This was the wrong solution,
but at 3 am it looked pretty damned good. Indeed, after 18 hours of solid coding
(not to mention the 60–70 hour weeks) it was all I could think of.
I remember feeling so good about myself for the long hours I was working.
I remember feeling dedicated. I remember thinking that working at 3 am is what
serious professionals do. How wrong I was!
That code came back to bite us over and over again. It instituted a faulty design
structure that everyone used but consistently had to work around. It caused all
kinds of strange timing errors and odd feedback loops. We’d get into infinite
mail loops as one message caused another to be sent, and then another,
infinitely. We never had time to rewrite this wad (so we thought) but we always
seemed to have time to add another wart or patch to work around it. The cruft
grew and grew, surrounding that 3 am code with ever more baggage and side
effects. Years later it had become a team joke. Whenever I was tired or frustrated
they’d say, “Look out! Bob’s about to send mail to himself!”
The moral of this story is: Don’t write code when you are tired. Dedication and
professionalism are more about discipline than hours. Make sure that your sleep,
health, and lifestyle are tuned so that you can put in eight good hours per day.

U.S. pension funds, corporations, and banks invest billions of dollars in the "cash" markets. Cash securities are generally considered those with a remaining term to maturity of less than one year, but can include those with maturities as long as five years. Incredibly diverse in nature, cash securities are actually negotiated between issuer and buyer, and new security types are frequently introduced into the market. WyCASH+ is a portfolio management system which provides basic accounting, record-keeping and reporting, as well as analytical computations to assist the manager of cash portfolios.

For the development of WyCASH+, Wyatt Software chose to employ object technology in order to quickly and effectively address the diversity present in the market. Objects help in two ways. First, many security types fit nicely into an inheritance hierarchy which is directly supported by our language (Smalltalk) saving us considerable effort in coding. Second, changing market demands often require massive revisions which we have been able to accomodate because of the modularity intrinsic in a totally object-oriented implementation. Our customers value our responsiveness as much as, if not more than, our product's fit to their current needs.

We developed the product by incremental growth from a working prototype. Each member of our small engineering team maintains at least general knowledge of all aspects of the roughly four megabytes of source code. This includes some libraries provided by the vendor and others written to our specification by third-party contractors. Mature sections of the program have been revised or rewritten many times providing the consolidation that is key to understanding and continued incremental development

We believe this process leads to the most appropriate product in the shortest possible time. There are pitfalls, however. Not everyone is comfortable with sudden changes in direction, especially programmers. Here the best antidote is more complete familiarity with the product and its implementation. Changes will be accepted when they are recognized as do-able.

Another, more serious pitfall is the failure to consolidate. Although immature code may work fine and be completely acceptable to the customer, excess quantities will make a program unmasterable, leading to extreme specialization of programmers and finally an inflexible product. Shipping first time code is like going into debt. A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite. Objects make the cost of this transaction tolerable. The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid. Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as interest on that debt. Entire engineering organizations can be brought to a stand-still under the debt load of an unconsolidated implementation, object- oriented or otherwise.

There is little doubt that Wyatt Software will continue to employ object technology. Thoroughly versed in the leading object-oriented languages, our only decision is how best to employ their advantages. The traditional waterfall development cycle has endeavored to avoid programming catastrophy by working out a program in detail before programming begins. We watch with some interest as the community attempts to apply these techniques to objects. However, using our debt analogy, we recognize this amounts to preserving the concept of payment up-front and in-full. The modularity offered by objects and the practice of consolidation make the alternative, incremental growth, both feasible and desirable (but not always comfortable) in the competitive financial software market.

"Work only as many hours as you can be productive and only as many hours
as you can sustain. Burning yourself out unproductively today and
spoiling the next two days' work isn't good for you or the team.

Where does this penchant for long hours come from? I'm often asked for
"scientific" evidence for the practices in XP, as if science could
somehow bear the responsibility for project success or failure. Work
hours are one area where I wish I could turn this argument around. Where
is the scientific evidence that members of a software team produce more
value in 80-hour weeks than in 40-hour weeks? Software development is a
game of insight, and insight comes to the prepared, relaxed mind.

In my own case I think I turn to long work hours as a way of grabbing
control in a situation in which I am otherwise out of control. I can't
control how the whole project is going; I can't control whether the
product sells; but I can always stay later. With enough caffeine and
sugar, I can keep typing long past the point where I have started
removing value from the project. It's easy to remove value from a
software project; but when you're tired, it's hard to recognize that
you're removing value.

When you're sick, respect yourself and the rest of your team by resting
and getting well. Taking care of yourself is the quickest way back to
energized work. You also protect the team from losing more productivity
because of illness. Coming in sick doesn't show commitment to work,
because you aren't working effectively.

You can make incremental improvements in work hours. Staying at work the
same amount of time but managing that time better is an improvement.
Declare a two-hour stretch each day as Code Time. Turn off the phones
and email notification, and just program for two hours. That may be
enough improvement for now and may set the stage for fewer hours at work
later."

Any of my staff from my days in Kansas City, reading this, will recall my first ever team meeting. I handed out a single page with about 10 bullet points on it. This represented my promise to them, the tenets by how I would manage the team. One of the bullets said, large scale software development is a marathon and not a sprint! I promised them that I would help the team achieve a sustainable pace and that we’d try to achieve a 40 hour working week for the team. At the time, I hadn’t read Kent Beck’s 1st edition of Extreme Programming Explained. My experience with the 40 hour week rule dated back to Singapore when Jeff De Luca and to a lesser extent Steve Palmer and I would tour the office about 6.15pm and ask individuals whether they were still working. If it was a “home job” (there own website or something similar) we’d let them stay, if it was project work, we’d strongly encourage them towards the door. In Singapore, the working week was/is 44 hours including 4 hours on a Saturday morning. But on week days, we tried hard to maintain a strict, 9am to 6pm with an hour for lunch, routine. We knew we had an 18 month project and we couldn’t have people burning out. Sustainable pace focused around an 8 hour working day was the theme.

"Watch any marathon, and each runner will keep it up for 26.2 miles.  Look more closely, however,  and you’ll notice that the pace is not entirely consistent from mile to mile.  Each works a little harder going up the hill and maybe recovers slightly coming down it.  At the finish line, most accelerate and sprint at a pace that is not sustainable beyond the finish line.

Sustainable pace should mean the same to a Scrum team:  Most of the time the team runs at a nice, even pace, but every now and then team members need to kick it up a gear, such as when nearing a finish line or perhaps attacking a critical, user-reported defect."

If a person alternates between energy expenditure and energy renewal throughout the day then his energy level will remain constant and his output will be high. If he spends his whole day expending energy he will eventually become exhausted and will then waste most of his time. He will waste his time because he didn't manage his energy.

To build capacity expend energy vigorously, and then restore it by resting. If a person does not expend energy, and only accumulates it, by resting or sleeping all day, then over time he reduces his capacity.

Use rituals to signal to your internal systems to ramp up and ramp down energy expenditure.

listening to music, meditating, practicing yoga, walking your dog, eating a healthy snack or taking a nap

precise, scheduled activity

Loehr and Schwarz argue that rituals are better. The 8 hour day is a ritual. Hence, the 40 hour week still makes sense but not as marathon rather than sprint, but as ritual rather than self-discipline

<!--
The Pomodoro Technique was conceived by an Italian in the 1980s, who tried to focus on upcoming exams, but was not getting anywhere due to procrastination. He came up with this idea: get a kitchen timer, set it to a specific time, like half an hour. In this period of time, do a single task. His kitchen timer was in the shape of a tomato, that's why the technique is called Pomodoro. A pomodoro is also the name of a single unit of focus time.

If you are unable to focus due to internal disturbances (wandering thoughts, need to check e-mails, etc) or external disturbances (phone's ringing, someone trying to talk to you), don't give in to the temptation to react in-depth immediately, but document it so you can address it after the pomodoro, then re-focus an continue. By this you get a better understanding of the concepts of urgency and importance (see also paragraph three of this blog post), and learn to get things done.

At the start of the day, you create a backlog of tasks. Then you pick a single task for the next pomodoro. The typical length of a pomodoro is 25 minutes, it is indivisible, so if you finish early, you should review your work, not start anything new. If you get interrupted by something important, the pomodoro is void. You can never resume a pomodoro, you have to start with a new one. If you have very small tasks, you can combine them into a single pomodoro, but this is not really recommended. After each pomodoro you have to do a 5 minute break, which is a real break where you are not allowed to do anything work related. Stand up, walk around, stretch, eat or drink, or tell someone a joke. After four pomodoros, a longer break of around 15 minutes is required.

If you manage to complete a pomodoro (which is different from completing a task), you can already consider it a success. You have managed to stay focussed, which is all you really can do. You can now measure how many pomodoros you get done in a day, it's quite tough if you do it by the book. I managed to get 7 pomodoros done last Friday (first day I tried it), but I was hoping for 10-12, so there is still some potential.

If we can pause, we create space. Space to breathe, to think, to be without acting.

The pause is the answer to so many of our problems. Such a small thing, and so powerful.

To develop the pause, notice your next urge. Is it an urge to go check something online? Or eat something you know isn’t healthy for you? Pay attention to the urge, learn as much as you can about it. If you act on it after the pause, that’s OK. Just notice it, and pause, and pay attention.

Do it again for the next urge, and the next. You will get good at it with practice, and you’ll have lots of opportunities to practice.

The urges won’t go away, but your ability to pause will get stronger. And when you have the pause, you have everything.

There are various concepts of time: For example, you can look at it as a continuous flow, or as a sequence of events. The first approach easily suggests that time is slipping away, you're running out of time, or that time is passing. This may lead to anxiety, and puts pressure on people trying to get things done.

If you look at it like a sequence of events, time does not exist independently of you, you are part of it. This puts you in control of time, not vice versa. The Pomodoro Technique tries to teach us the second perspective by having successive periods of focus time, which help you find a rhythm, which again gives you security.

Another thing the technique tries to do is to act as a focus enabler. Imagine a professional football player always tying the left shoe first, and then the right shoe. You might think of it as superstition, but it is a ritual which helps the person build focus on the upcoming event. Just like this, the winding of the pomodoro timer acts as a focus enabler. The winding symbolizes your commitment to the next pomodoro and helps you get in a flow. It is recommended to use a mechanical timer, as you would not get the same feeling with a software timer.

There was no mention of more sex or bungee jumps. A palliative nurse who has counselled the dying in their last days has revealed the most common regrets we have at the end of our lives. And among the top, from men in particular, is 'I wish I hadn't worked so hard'.

Bronnie Ware is an Australian nurse who spent several years working in palliative care, caring for patients in the last 12 weeks of their lives. She recorded their dying epiphanies in a blog called Inspiration and Chai, which gathered so much attention that she put her observations into a book called The Top Five Regrets of the Dying.

Ware writes of the phenomenal clarity of vision that people gain at the end of their lives, and how we might learn from their wisdom. "When questioned about any regrets they had or anything they would do differently," she says, "common themes surfaced again and again."
